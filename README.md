# <i>WikiAnnotator</i>

## Introduction

WikiAnnotator is a tool that allows users to search for Wikipedia articles using the WikiMedia API and markup those articles using a rich text editor.

## Getting Started with WikiAnnotator

First, head over to the app at https://wikiannotator.com. If this is your first time using WikiAnnotator, click the "Create account?" button to create an account using your email address.

Once you're logged in you'll be greeted by the home page. From here you can either view previously saved articles ("View saved articles") or search for a new article to annotate ("Find a new article"). If you're searching for a new article, you'll be taken to the Search view where you can enter a search term and selected your desired article from the results. Once you've clicked on an article, you'll be taken to the editor where you can add your annotations. Whenever you're finished, simply click the Save button and your article will appear in the "Saved articles" view. Click on the "Saved articles" tab will show you all the articles that you've saved so far and allow you to either continue editing them or delete them if you wish. If you prefer working in the dark, check out the Dark Mode switch in the upper right corner of the app! 

If you'd like to log out and end your session, simply use the "Log out" button in the navigation bar.
